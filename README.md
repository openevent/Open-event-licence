# Open-event-licence
Open event the world's first open event license.
Every event that is an ‘open event’ can use the license freely. By using the license the event organiser grants certain rights to people visiting the event.

The Open Event license is a social license, and is inspired by the Creative Commons license or other open licenses alike. We invite everyone to use this license and to share our common goals with others.
