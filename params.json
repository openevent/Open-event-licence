  "body": "### Open event license .\r\nThe open event could be the world's first open event license. \r\n\r\nEvery event that is an ‘open event’ can use the license freely. By using the license the event organiser grants certain rights to people visiting the event.\r\n\r\nThe Open Event license is a social license, and is inspired by the [Creative Commons](creativecommons.org) license or other open licenses alike. We invite everyone to use this license and to share our common goals with others. \r\n\r\n\r\n### A) An event with an open event license is:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ### For free.  The event has an open door policy. There is no entrance fee, or the entrance fee will be waived upon simple request by the visitor. \r\n  \r\n2. Not for profit. It is a non-profit event, primarily focusing on bringing people together, and is not focusing on selling stuff.  \r\n\r\n3. An open space. \r\n \t\r\nDepending on the choice of the organiser, the event can be to different degrees a free, open or shared space. The license allows to indicate the following:\r\n\r\n3.1 Own food and drinks. \r\nPeople are allowed to bring their own food and drinks to the event.\r\n\r\n3.2 Free Stage. \r\nThe event-organiser facilitates a free stage for event participants. People are allowed and invited to make own music in the event, or ‘take the stage’ if they wish to address fellow visitors.\r\n\r\n3.3 Free Wi-Fi\r\nThe event-organiser provides free/open Wi-Fi access without restrictions.\r\n\r\n### B) Our common goals are:\r\n\r\n1. OPEN This project tries to support an open society bringing together people from different backgrounds.\r\n2. SHARE This project tries to remove the barriers for the sharing of experiences, stories and cultures.\r\n3. CONNECT This project makes it possible for events to connect with each other and the public, and stand out as  being explicitly open and social.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
